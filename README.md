            Open Minds - Youtube Explorer
            OM Youtube Explorer is an experience to play with:
            
                Pyython 3   
                Flask 0.14   
                Bootstrap 4   
                Docker   
                AWS   
                And of course API's, in this case the YouTube API   
            Also the idea is to explore microframeworks by oposition of more usual and well know Django.     

                    This is a work in progress.     
                    So, if you are curious about it, come often that will be enhancements.
